# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data pertaining to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls, to convince potenitial clients to subscrobe to bank's term deposit.  we seek to predict to predict whether the potential client would accept to make a term deposit at the bank or not.


The best performing model found using AutoML was a Voting Ensemble with 91.6% accuracy, while the accuarcy of Logistic classifier implemented using hyperdrive was 90.7%

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

Performed random sampling over the hyperparameter search space using RandomParameterSampling in our parameter sampler, this drastically reduces computation time and we are still able to find reasonably good models when compared to GridParameterSampling methodology where all the possible values from the search space are used, and it supports early termination of low-performance runs

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

BanditPolicy is used here which is an "aggressive" early stopping policy. It cuts more runs than a conservative policy like the MedianStoppingPolicy, hence saving the computational time significantly. Configuration Parameters:-

1. slack_factor/slack_amount : (factor)The slack allowed with respect to the best performing training run.(amount) Specifies the allowable slack as an absolute amount, instead of a ratio. Set to 0.1.

2. evaluation_interval : (optional) The frequency for applying the policy. Set to 1.

3. delay_evaluation : (optional) Delays the first policy evaluation for a specified number of intervals. Set to 5.



## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
